PROGRESS
    - "Deterministic" Random generator has been created
    - Genetics Algorithm class has been created
    - Grammatical Evolution class has been created (inherited from Genetics Algorithm) and implemented

PROBLEM
    - the nature of GE <-- it is purely random trial-error
    - GE is exhaustive
    - it is too late to change the topics
    - Get the ground-truth in a convenient form
    
SOLUTION
    - The scenario should be changed
    - It is related to "how do we usually think"
        some tasks are solved by using deterministic approach (e.g : calculate this : f(x) = x^2+3x+1, for x=4)
        some tasks are solved by using trial-error approach (e.g : we should try some of all possible value to find the best threshold)
    - Feature construction by using GE (already make Go_GEFCS class), classification by using neural network (possibly use pyneurgen)
    - More regression than classification
    
ANOTHER PROBLEM
    - Is it true that pearson-correlation can be used?
    
FUTURE WORKS
    - Solve the problem
    - finish the implementation

feature extraction in local thresholding problem by using grammatical evolution
