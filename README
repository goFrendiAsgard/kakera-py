"kakera" means "pieces" in japanese. That's it, kakera-py is pieces I made to learn python and doing homework. It is much more effective than PHP since there are already a bunch of packages available for python.

To use this, you (or future me) will need to install:
-python 2.7
-numpy
-scipy
-scikits-learn
-scikits-image
and optionally
-eclipse with pydev
