Case:
    abalone datasets with 9 features and 1 objective. 
    The features are : 
        'sex', 'length', 'diameter', 'height', 'whole_weight', 
        'shucked_weight', 'viscera_weight', 'shell_weight', 'rings'
    The objective is 'age' which is = rings+1.5

Workflow:
    Original Features ---GE--> Constructed Features ---NN--> Class

Original Features are taken from abalone datasets (we ommit rings):
    'sex', 'length', 'diameter', 'height', 'whole_weight', 
    'shucked_weight', 'viscera_weight', 'shell_weight'

By Using GE, we construct these features:
    ((whole_weight)-(shucked_weight))+(length)
    ((whole_weight)-(shucked_weight))+(diameter)
    ((whole_weight)-(viscera_weight))+(length)
    ((whole_weight)-(viscera_weight))+(diameter)
    ((height)-(viscera_weight))+(whole_weight)
    ((whole_weight)-(1))+(length)
    ((whole_weight)-(8))+(length)
    ((whole_weight)-(43))+(length)
    ((whole_weight)-(23))+(length)
    ((whole_weight)-(7))+(diameter)
    
 The constructed features have pearson correlation with the output 
 (the biggest correlation is 0.78), 
 therefore we confidence that such a features can classify dataset as expected
 
 TODO:
    - a good feature should have correlation with the target, but should not has
        correlation with other features
    - classifier : neural network or svm, or even both :D
